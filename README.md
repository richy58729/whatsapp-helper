# WhatsApp helper #

## Web page with some JavaScript to help with using https://wa.me for sending a WhatsApp message to a telephone number ##

With this, you can use [https://wa.me/](https://wa.me/) to send a WhatsApp message to a telephone number by means of a web browser, meant mainly to be used on a desktop pc, but it should also work on a smartphone. It assumes you are either using the WhatsApp desktop client or WhatsApp web in the same browser.

To use this, you need a web server. Which software you use for the web server, is irrelevant, as it is just a static HTML page with some JavaScript and CSS.
